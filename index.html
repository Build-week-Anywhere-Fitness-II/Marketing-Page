                        These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While you could use several mobile apps to accomplish this, AnywhereFitness is the all-in-one solution to meet your “on-location” fitness class needs. AnywhereFitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.
